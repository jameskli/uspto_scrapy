# USPTO Scraping and Analysis with Scrapy
## Description
* Downloads USPTO data using `Scrapy`
* Performs cleanup on messy data
* Makes a best-guess of location using a frequency analysis of similar patents.

## Notes
* USPTO data is extremely messy as the older Patent pages are hand-coded.
* A lot of the data exploration steps have a lot of hard-coded data.
* a lot of cleanup steps were required.
* Therefore, this is meant only for demonstration purpose.
* Data files have been removed.

## Outcome
* An analysis of patents generated by entities in Mississauga, Ontario Canada vs location of current assignees
* Extracted __~80,000__ patents
* A study prepared for the City of Missisauga
